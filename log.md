# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 2019 October 19, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: As I just started and IÂ´m unsure about a right project to start I solved a coding challenge from [EntwicklerHeld](https://platform.entwicklerheld.de).

**Thoughts:** Good starting point to warm up my Python knowledge. First struggled on the algorithm / plan I wanted to implement, but not with the language or syntax. Therefore it should be no problem to go for something more challenging / a first project the next days. Maybe something related to [streamlit library](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit) before I dig deeper into Django.
