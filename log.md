# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 2019 October 19, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: As I just started and I´m unsure about a right project to start I solved a coding challenge from [EntwicklerHeld](https://platform.entwicklerheld.de).

**Thoughts:** Good starting point to warm up my Python knowledge. First struggled on the algorithm / plan I wanted to implement, but not with the language or syntax. Therefore it should be no problem to go for something more challenging / a first project the next days. Maybe something related to [streamlit library](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit) before I dig deeper into Django.

### Day 2: 2019 October 20, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I started a first project to simulate the german board game "Mensch ärgere dich nicht". Implemented a first draft of the Board class and the Player class with the possibility to roll and place game figures.

**Thoughts:** I chose this to get deeper into the object oriented mindset as my past experiences are mostly related to functional programming. Needed to look up some stuff but basically there are no blockers currently. Let's see how long it takes to finish the full game sim.

### Day 3: 2019 October 21, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Added an id attribute and a move_figure method to the Player class of my new "Mensch ärgere dich nicht" project.

**Thoughts:** Could have achieved more but got stuck by a bug. I should consider improving debugging skills / learning more about logging implementation.

### Day 4: 2019 October 22, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Implemented a logic to ban other player figures into my "Mensch ärgere dich nicht" project.

**Thoughts:** Guess it will take 1-2 days more to finish the main logic. Looking forward to work with the resulting game simulation data then! Read an [article about software design and architecture](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/software-design/) from freeCodeCamp today. Was very informative and opened my eyes that there are also some theoretical topics which I should look up soon.
